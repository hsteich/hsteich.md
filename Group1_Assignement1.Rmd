Assignment: Simulation of Probability Models in R


Problem 1
A random process in which events occur continuously and independently at a
constant average rate of α is called a Poisson process. For example the number
of phone calls to a corporate office in one hour with an average of 6 is a Poisson
random variable with parameter α = 6.
The time between successive events in a Poisson process follows the Exponential
distribution with parameter lambda where 1
lambda
denotes the mean time. For
instance in the example above, the time between calls to the corporate office is
exponentially distributed with a mean of 10 minutes. (Note that α = λt). See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution to learn more
about the Exponential random variable and its characteristics.
Hint: You may find the commands dexp (finds PDF), pexp (finds CDF), and
qexp (finds inverse CDF, opposite of pexp) in R helpful in answering following
questions.
1. Plot the probability density function of the time between calls to the
corporate office mentioned above.
2. What is the probability that time between two successive calls to this
office will be longer than 10 minutes?
3. 90% of calls made to this office takes less than x seconds. What’s x?
Problem 2
Assume that you flip a fair coin 30 times. You observe the sequence of heads
and tails in your experiment. A run is a sequence of all heads or tails.
1. You’re interested in finding the information about the longest run. Simulate
in R, the experiment described above 10,000 times and each time
note the length of the longest run. Find the average of the longest run
in 10,000 simulations and report it. Hint: The rle command in R will be
helpful.
2. What is the probability of getting a run of 7 or more in 30 coin flips based
on your simulation? Does your calculation for this probability follow the
frequentists’ or Bayesian’s view of probability?
